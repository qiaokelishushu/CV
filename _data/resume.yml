  - title: China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch Credit Scoring Card Project
    duration: 2022.8 - 2023.5
    detail: I. Project Introduction:As a risk strategy analyst at China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch, I encountered the challenge of improving the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk assessment.
            II. Main Work:1. My task was to propose and implement a project using the GPT-4 model to develop credit scoring card models.
                           2.  I led the collection and cleaning of extensive customer credit data, used Python's Pandas library for data preprocessing, and applied the GPT-4 model for feature engineering and model training. Post-training, I tested and evaluated the model using a test dataset.
            III. Project Results:The project resulted in improved credit assessment accuracy and efficiency, reduced the bank's risk exposure, and promoted technological innovation and knowledge sharing within the bank.
