  - title: China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch Credit Scoring Card Project
    duration: 2022.8 - 2023.5
    detail: I. Project Introduction: During my tenure as a risk strategy analyst at China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch, I proposed and participated in an important project, using the GPT-4 model to assist in the development of credit scoring card models. The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk assessment to better support the bank's credit decision-making process. By applying advanced natural language processing and deep learning technologies, we have developed an innovative scoring card model that can automatically analyze the text information of customer applications and predict their credit risk.
            II. Main Work: 1. Data collection and cleaning: We collected a large amount of customer credit data, including customer personal information, credit history, loan details, etc. I used Python's Pandas library for data cleaning and preprocessing, deleted duplicate data, filled in missing values, and also converted some categorical data into numerical data.
                           2. Feature engineering: I used the GPT-4 model to analyze the text of customer loan applications and extracted some important features, such as the sentiment orientation of the application reasons, keywords, etc. These features were used to enhance the predictive performance of the credit scoring card.
                           3. Model training: I used decision tree models, random forest algorithms, etc. in Python's Sklearn library for model training. I also optimized the model with the GPT-4 model, which automatically wrote some code through its natural language generation capability, adjusted hyperparameters, and improved the accuracy of the model.
                           4. Model testing and evaluation: After the model training was completed, I used the test dataset to test the model and evaluate the model's performance. The GPT-4 model also provided help in this process, generating a model evaluation report, and detailedly explaining the model's performance.
            III. Project Results: 1. Improve the accuracy of credit assessment: By using the GPT-4 model, we can more comprehensively analyze the text information of customer applications and conduct a comprehensive assessment in conjunction with traditional credit data. This allows the scoring card model to more accurately predict the credit default risk of customers, reducing the bank's risk exposure.
                                  2. Improve the efficiency of credit assessment: With the automation capability of theGPT-4 model, we can quickly process a large amount of application text, reducing the workload of manual processing. In this way, the bank's credit decision-making team can process applications more efficiently and make accurate decisions in a shorter time.
                                  3. Technological innovation and knowledge sharing: This project brought opportunities for technological innovation to the Shanghai Branch of China Minsheng Bank. We actively researched and applied advanced natural language processing and deep learning technologies, promoted technical growth and exchange within the department through sharing knowledge and experience with team members. We continuously explored new models and algorithms and applied them to the field of credit assessment, bringing technological breakthroughs and innovations to the bank.
  
  - title: China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch Anti-Fraud Project
    duration: 2022.8 - 2023.5
    detail: I. Project Introduction: During my tenure as a risk strategy analyst at China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch, I was responsible for proposing and participating in an important project, using machine learning and artificial intelligence technology for fraud detection. The project aims to protect the bank from losses due to fraudulent activities and improve the ability to identify potential fraudulent activities. By applying advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, we have developed an innovative fraud detection system that can automatically analyze and identify suspicious transactions and accurately identify potential fraudulent activities.
            II. Main Work: 1. Data collection and preprocessing: We collected a large amount of bank transaction data, including transaction time, amount, transaction type, customer information, etc. I used Python's Pandas library to preprocess the data, including cleaning up outliers, filling in missing data, standardizing numerical data, etc.
                           2. Feature engineering: I used the GPT-4 model for text analysis, analyzing the transaction descriptions of customers, extracting important features such as transaction frequency, transaction patterns, etc., to improve the predictive performance of the model.
                           3. Model training: I chose the random forest algorithm in Python's Sklearn library as our model, and used the collected data to train the model. GPT-4 also provided help in this process, automatically writing some code through its natural language generation capability, adjusting hyperparameters, and improving the accuracy of the model.
                           4. Model testing and evaluation: After the model training was completed, I used the test dataset to test the model and evaluate the model's performance. The GPT-4 model also provided help in this process, generating a model evaluation report, and detailedly explaining the model's performance.
           III. Project Results: 1. Reduce fraud losses: By using machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, we successfully reduced the fraud losses of China Minsheng Bank Shanghai Branch. By building an efficient fraud detection model, we can timely identify suspicious transaction behaviors and take necessary measures to mitigate the bank's risk exposure.
                           2. Improve the efficiency of fraud detection: With the automation capability of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, we can efficiently process a large amount of transaction data and accurately identify suspicious transaction behaviors. This efficiency helps the bank to detect fraud in a shorter time and take necessary actions.
                           3. Enhance defensive capabilities: By introducing machine learning and artificial intelligence technology for fraud detection, we have improved the bank's defensive capabilities against evolving fraud methods. We continuously improve and optimize the fraud detection system to adapt to new fraud patterns and techniques, thereby better protecting the interests of the bank.
                           4. Technological innovation and knowledge sharing: This project promoted technological innovation and knowledge sharing. By sharing the latest machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies with team members, we continuously improve and optimize the fraud detection system, improving the technical level and innovative capabilities of the team.
